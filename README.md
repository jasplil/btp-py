# BTP XSUAA simple demo

## Using XSUAA in Cloud Foundry on BTP

This README provides guidance on how to use the XSUAA (Authorization and Trust Management) service on BTP in python and Node.js.

## 1. Introduction

XSUAA (Authorization and Trust Management) is a service provided by Cloud Foundry that enables secure authentication and authorization for applications. It allows you to manage access control to your application's resources and APIs.

This README serves as a guide to understanding and using XSUAA in Cloud Foundry applications.

## 2. What is XSUAA

XSUAA is an OAuth2-based service that provides:

- Authentication: User authentication through various identity providers.
- Authorization: Access control to your application's resources based on defined policies.

## 3. Prerequisites

Before using XSUAA, ensure you have the following:

- A Cloud Foundry account with access to the XSUAA service.
- A Cloud Foundry space and an application where you want to implement XSUAA security.
- Knowledge of OAuth2 and understanding of the roles and scopes required for your application.

## 4. Setting Up XSUAA

To set up XSUAA for your Cloud Foundry application, follow these steps:

1. Create a new instance of the XSUAA service in your Cloud Foundry space.
2. Configure the XSUAA service instance with the necessary security settings, roles, and scopes for your application.

## 5. Binding XSUAA to Applications

Once you have set up XSUAA, you need to bind it to your Cloud Foundry applications. This allows your application to leverage the security features provided by XSUAA.

To bind XSUAA to your application:

1. Go to your application's manifest file and add the XSUAA service instance as a dependency.
2. Restage your application to apply the changes.

## 6. Securing Endpoints with XSUAA

XSUAA enables you to secure your application's endpoints with fine-grained access control. To secure specific endpoints:

1. Define scopes and roles in the XSUAA service instance that correspond to the permissions required for accessing each endpoint.
2. Use the XSUAA library in your application code to enforce authentication and authorization based on these scopes and roles.

## 7. Accessing XSUAA-Secured Resources

Once you have secured your application's endpoints with XSUAA, users will need to authenticate and obtain a valid access token to access those resources.
